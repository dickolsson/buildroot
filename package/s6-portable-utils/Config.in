	  s6-portable-utils is a set of tiny general Unix utilities,
	  often performing well-known tasks such as cut and grep, but
	  optimized for simplicity and small size. They were designed
	  for embedded systems and other constrained environments, but
	  they work everywhere.

config BR2_PACKAGE_S6_PORTABLE_UTILS_RENAME
	bool "Rename utilities"

	  Rename utilities to their POSIX-equivalent name. This might
	  help building a more coherent base system using s6-portable-utils.

	  Select this option if you want to rename the utilities that are
	  fully compliant to their POSIX-equivalent name.

config BR2_PACKAGE_S6_PORTABLE_UTILS_RENAME_POSIX_PART
	bool "Partly POSIX-compliant utilities"

	  Select this option if you want to rename the utilities that are
	  partly compliant to their POSIX-equivalent name.

config BR2_PACKAGE_S6_PORTABLE_UTILS_RENAME_POSIX_ALT
	bool "Alternatives to POSIX utilities"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to rename the utilities that are
	  alternative and non-compliant to their POSIX-equivalent name.

	  Only select this option if you really know what you are doing.
	  It will most likely break lots of other utilities and shell
	  scripts. But this option might be useful for building small,
	  secure and more user-friendly base systems with s6-portable-utils.
