	  This platform will only boot from flash address 0x0.
	  It should therefore be used as the first bootloader.

	  Configuration for QEMU targeting the Virt machine.
	  This platform can boot from either flash address 0x0 or via
	  the Linux boot protocol. It can therefore be loaded by a
	  previous bootloader like ARM Trusted Firmware or OP-TEE.

	  The EDK2 build system itself will package the ATF binaries.
